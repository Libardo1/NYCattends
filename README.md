NYCattends: NYCDOE attendance archive
-------------------------------------

The NYCDOE [publishes](bit.ly/NYCattends) a daily attendance report, but it doesn't seem possible to access historical reports, so I'm downloading them every day and putting them up here.

These are exactly the DOE's XML documents, renamed to include the date. They're exactly what you'd get if you downloaded from this address after four o'clock on the day of interest:
